				<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
				<div class="rte">
					<br><br>
					<b>Product Guarantee</b><br>
					The product description within the order summary will be the product you receive, guaranteed. If the product is not as described, UCB will not charge you for the item or for delivery and will make every effort to replace the load to that which was described.
					<br><br>
					When your order arrives, you have 3 days to inspect it and inform your UsedCardboardBoxes representative of any discrepancies (include pictures and detailed description) from what you ordered. If you received the boxes you ordered, but decided to reject or return them, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility.
					<br><br>

					<b>Shipping Guarantee</b><br>
					We do not have a shipping guarantee, as we utilize 3rd party carriers. Our shipping costs are calculated using market rates offered at the time of sale and timelines are provided by the carrier. As we deal with mostly full truckload orders, an estimation of 1 business day per 500 miles of transit can be used to estimate transit time. For LTL orders, the carrier generally makes their own timelines and can take considerably longer than full truckload shipments.
					<br><br>

					We will make every effort to communicate shipping and delivery expectations at every point of the process, including but not limited to when a carrier is assigned, when the load is picked up, scheduling a delivery appointment, and confirming delivery and satisfaction.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Returns</b><br>
					If you received the boxes you ordered, but decided to reject or return them, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Refunds</b><br>
					In the case of a refund, your original payment method will be refunded in the amount for the order, minus any freight charges to and from your facility and any other applicable fees associated with the transaction. You will be notified of the refund amount with a full itemization of any fees. Upon processing, refunds can generally take up to a week to hit your account.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Late or Missing Refunds</b><br>
					If you are owed a refund and it hasn’t been posted within the described time period, then please first follow up with your bank and/or credit card company. Often times, these institutions will have their own policies for refund credit processing timelines beyond our own. If you have done this and an understanding has not been reached, please contact us at 323.724.2500 x709 or email Operations@UsedCardboardBoxes.com so we can provide you with an update.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Sale Items</b><br>
					If you received the boxes you ordered, and they were on sale, but decided to reject or return them, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility in the same way as regularly priced items.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Exchanges</b><br>
					If you received the boxes you ordered, but decided to exchange them for a different item, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility for both the original load, as well as delivery for the replacement.
					<br><br>					
					
					<b>Shipping</b><br>
					If you received the boxes you ordered, but decided to reject, return, or exchange them for a different item, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility for both the original load, as well as delivery for any replacements.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Cancellations</b><br>
					If you would like to cancel your order prior to it shipping, you are welcome to do so and will not be charged. If you were already charged, you will be refunded the full amount of the purchase.
					
					If you would like to cancel your order after it has already shipped, you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility, as well as any additional fees by the carrier. If you have not already paid, this will be invoiced to you. If you have already paid, this will be deducted from your refund.
