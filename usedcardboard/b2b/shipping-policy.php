					<b>Shipping Guarantee</b><br>
					We do not have a shipping guarantee, as we utilize 3rd party carriers. 
					<br><br>

					<b>Shipping Costs</b><br>
					Our shipping costs are calculated using market rates offered at the time of sale and timelines are provided by the carrier. We work with market leaders, such as Uber Freight, to offer competitive pricing from anywhere, to anywhere in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Order Fulfillment Times</b><br>
					The time it takes to fulfill and order is dependent on whether or not the inventory item is accumulated in the amounts which were ordered, as well as required lead times by the processing facilities. Both factors are considered in the “Availability” estimation provided on the item description page.
					<br><br>
					
					We cannot make any guarantees for fulfillment times or exact availability because of the nature of used boxes being unpacked on timelines which can change. For example, if a company is normally unpacking 1,000 boxes per week but then decides to shut down for routine maintenance, they may stop unpacking boxes for a week, meaning it will take longer to accumulate an order of 10,000 someone may have ordered. These variances are part of the industry.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Delivery/Transit Times</b><br>
					For full truckload (FTL) orders, an estimation of 1 business day per 500 miles of transit can be used to estimate transit time. 
					<br><br>
					
					For less-than-truckload (LTL) orders, the carrier generally makes their own timelines and can take considerably longer than full truckload shipments. These are entirely planned by the LTL carrier.
					<br><br>
					
					We will make every effort to communicate shipping and delivery expectations at every point of the process, including but not limited to when a carrier is assigned, when the load is picked up, scheduling a delivery appointment, and confirming delivery and satisfaction.
					<br><br>

					<b>Delivery Refusal Policy</b><br>
					If you refuse delivery, then you will be responsible for freight to and from your facility.
